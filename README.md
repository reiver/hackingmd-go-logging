# HACKING.md for Logging in Golang

A `HACKING.md` file is a document with technical information that provides guidance for contributors to **understand**, and to **make changes** to a project.

This [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) file is the _default_ `HACKING.md` file that I use for **logging** in the **Go programming-language** (**golang**).

This `HACKING.md` file can be imported into an `AGENTS.md` and `SKILLS.md` file.

## Installation

This can be _installed_ into a `git` repo by adding it as a _git submodule_:

```bash
mkdir hacking

cd hacking

git submodule add https://github.com/reiver/hackingmd-go-logging
```
